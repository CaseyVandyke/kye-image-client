        Hi my name is KyLee, and I love photography and am very passionate about
        what I do. I was trained and certified from a top Utah company and am
        trained to give you quality images. I care about your pictures just as
        much as you do, and do whatever it takes to capture the real beautiful
        you! Not only do I want you to love your pictures, but I want you to
        enjoy the overall experience! I treasure the wonderful friendships that
        photography brings, it is a career that I truly enjoy!

        A little about me, I am married to my sweetest husband Aaron who brings
        me so much happiness. We are temporarily in Nebraska while he goes to
        Creighton Dental school and have absolutely loved our time here. I
        travel back to Utah often for shoots and family visits so am open for
        booking at both locations! Thanks so much for checking out my page, I
        would love to work for you!
